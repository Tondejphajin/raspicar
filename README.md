# raspicar

In this project, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B and various sensors to build a self-driving car. 
The Raspberry Pi Cam v.2 was used for image processing and lane tracking, while ultrasonic sensors were used 
to detect obstacles in the car's path. Temperature sensors were also included to monitor the car's internal 
and external temperature. Using these sensors and the Raspberry Pi's powerful processing capabilities, 
we were able to develop a fully autonomous vehicle that can navigate its surroundings and make decisions on its own.
